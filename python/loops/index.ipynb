[Wind turbines can handle winds up to 40-72 meters per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine_design) before measures have to be taken to limit their rotation.

    "We will find observations greater than 35 meters per second and append them to a `gusts` list. There are a few ways we could achieve this objective with Python. We could employ a `while` statement or the `range` function to enumerate incrementally through the list index to retrieve the value at a particular list index. This style of programming is familiar to Fortran or C family languages with the inevitable `for` loops (e.g., `for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)`). But often, keeping track of the list index is completely unnecessary. We are simply proceeding through a list, grabbing values of interest. In Python, when trying to process a list, instinctively gravitate towards using a `for` loop statement:\n",

We could have written a statement such as `for observation in data` to retrieve each `observation` tuple in the series and subsequently pull apart the `time` and `obs` using tuple operations. Python, however, allows us to pull the tuple apart right in the `for` statement, yielding a concise way to obtain the observation. After that, we test the wind gust speed and append it to the `gusts` list if the wind speed exceeds the threshold.\n",
