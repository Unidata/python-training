    "# Times and Dates\n",
    "Time is an essential component of nearly all geoscience data. Timescales span orders of magnitude from microseconds for lightning, hours for a supercell thunderstorm, days for a global weather model, millenia and beyond for the earth's climate. To properly analyze geoscience data, you must have a firm understanding of how to handle time in Python. In this notebook, we will examine the Python Standard Library for handling dates and times. We will also briefly make use of the [pytz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz) module to handle some thorny time zone issues in Python.\n",

(The full description of the data are [described here](https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/uso/ds_docs/vaiconus/vaiconus_dataset.html#a6).) In order to parse this string or others that follow the same format, you will employ the [datetime.strptime()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime) method from the `datetime` module. This method takes two arguments: the first is the date time string you wish to parse, the second is the format which describes exactly how the date and time are arranged. [The full range of format options is described in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior). In reality, the format will take some degree of experimentation to get right. This is a situation where Python shines as you can quickly try out different solutions in the IPython interpreter. Beyond the official documentation, Google and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are your friends in this process. Eventually, after some trial and error, you will find the <code>'%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S.%f'</code> format will properly parse the date and time."

For example, typing the following URL in a web browser will return a human-readable nested data structure called a [JSON object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) which will contain the data along with additional \"metadata\" to help you interpret the data (e.g., units etc.).

    "\n",
    "Let's suppose we are looking at coastal tide and current data perhaps in a [tropical cyclone storm surge scenario](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/). The [lunar day](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/tides/media/supp_tide05.html) is 24 hours, 50 minutes with two low tides and two high tides in that time duration. If we know the time of the current high tide, we can easily calculate the occurrence of the next low and high tides with the `timedelta` class. (In reality, the *exact time* of tides is influenced by local coastal effects, in addition to the laws of celestial mechanics, but we will ignore that fact for this exercise.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `timedelta` class is initialized by supplying time duration usually supplied with [keyword arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument) to clearly express the length of time. Significantly, you can use the `timedelta` class with arithmetic operators (i.e., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to obtain new dates and times as the next code sample illustrates. This convenient language feature is known as [operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading) and again illustrates Python's batteries-included philosophy of making life easier for the programmer. (In another language such as Java, you would have to call a method significantly obfuscating the code.) Another great feature is that the difference of two times will yield a `datetime` object. Let's examine all these features in the following code block."

    "## Dealing with Time Zones\n",
    "\n",
    "Time zones can be a source of confusion and frustration in geoscientific data and in computer programming in general. Core date and time libraries in various programming languages inevitably have design flaws (Python is no different) leading to third-party libraries that attempt to fix the core library limitations. To avoid these issues, it is best to handle data in UTC, or at the very least operate in a consistent time zone, but that is not always possible. Users will expect their tornado alerts in local time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is UTC?\n",
    "\n",
    "[UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) is an abbreviation of Coordinated Universal Time and is equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), in practice. (Greenwich at 0 degrees longitude, is a district of London, England.) In geoscientific data, times are often in UTC though you should always verify this assumption is actually true!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Zone Naive Versus Time Zone Aware `datetime` Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create `datetime` objects in Python, they are so-called \"naive\" which means they are time zone unaware. In many situations, you can happily go forward without this detail getting in the way of your work. As the [Python documentation states](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html): \"Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with, at the cost of ignoring some aspects of reality\". However, if you wish to convey time zone information, you will have to make your `datetime` objects time zone aware. In order to handle time zones in Python, you will need the third-party [pytz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz) module whose classes build upon, or \"inherit\" in OO terminology, from the `tzinfo` class. You cannot solely rely on the Python Standard Library unfortunately. Here, we create time zone naive and time zone aware `datetime` objects:"
